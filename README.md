Huge thanks for MarkHC/CSGOSimple for the base and to anyone who updated it after MarkHC stopped working on it! Also huge thanks for Nero and Toni and Jussi for teaching me the ways of working around source SDK.

This is yet another internal cheat using Marks base containing new features and whatnot!

Use your own loadlibrary DLL injector to use it!
